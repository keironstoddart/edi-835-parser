### Installation
Binary installers for the latest released version are at the Python Package Index. Please note that you need to run Python 3.8 or higher to install the edi-835-parser.
```
pip install edi-835-parser
```

### Usage
To parse an EDI 835 file simply execute the `parse` function.
```python
from edi_835_parser import parse

path = '~/Desktop/my_edi_file.txt'
transaction_set = parse(path)
```
The `parse` function also works on a directory path.
```python
from edi_835_parser import parse

path = '~/Desktop/my_directory_of_edi_files'
transaction_sets = parse(path)
```
In both cases, `parse` returns an instance of the `TransactionSets` class. 
This is the class you manipulate depending on your needs. 
For example, say you want to work with the transaction sets data as a `pd.DataFrame`.
```python
from edi_835_parser import parse

path = '~/Desktop/my_directory_of_edi_files'
transaction_sets = parse(path)

data = transaction_sets.to_dataframe()
```
And then save that `pd.DataFrame` as a `.csv` file.
```python
data.to_csv('~/Desktop/my_edi_file.csv')
```
The complete set of `TransactionSets` functionality can be found by inspecting the `TransactionSets` 
class found at `edi_parser/transaction_set/transaction_sets.py`

### Tests
Example EDI 835 files can be found in `tests/test_edi_835/files`. To run the tests use `pytest`.
```
python -m pytest
```
